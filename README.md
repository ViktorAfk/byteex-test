First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. You can find the clone URL on the repository page on GitHub; You need to install dependencies run 'pnpm instal';

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Project includes: One product page replicated according to Figma design. For dynamic content I used strapi-cms, [link](https://github.com/ViktorAfk/strapi-cms) to strapi repo.

Technical Considerations:
 • Next.js for building the components and managing state.
 • TailwindCSS for styling and Embla Carousel for slider animations.
 • For backend purposes I used strapi-cms.
